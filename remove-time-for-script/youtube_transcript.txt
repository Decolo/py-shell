00:00:00.090  [CC may contain inaccuracies] It's interesting, right?
When you talk about I know your favorite
00:00:02.250  topic is talk about risk and how to look
at risk taking here when you you could
00:00:06.330  argue that the US cycle is getting, I
guess, towards the late part of things.
00:00:10.830  Asia.
In some ways it's still in the thick of
00:00:13.230  it and re-emerging from this pandemic in
some ways as well.
00:00:16.440  How are you looking at these diverging
cycles around the world here right now?
00:00:20.100  And is it a time still to be a
contrarian?
00:00:27.780  You know, the US had a brief period of
difficulty in the second quarter of
00:00:33.240  2020.
The economy rebounded very nicely in the
00:00:36.450  third quarter and has been doing very
well since then.
00:00:40.170  Despite the fact that interest rates
have not been cut.
00:00:43.410  There are people arguing for stimulus,
but so far they haven't gotten it.
00:00:47.070  It doesn't seem there's a need to
stimulate it, given how well the economy
00:00:51.060  is doing and how labor is doing.
But, you know,
00:00:57.390  obviously, as you say, other countries
are not quite doing quite as well.
00:01:01.320  There seems to be some asynchronous
elements in the global monetary picture.
00:01:07.860  But, you know, I think that most things
are going in the right direction.
00:01:11.700  People are very happy investing in the
in the United States.
00:01:17.610  They like our the legal system, economic
system, the corporate sector.
00:01:24.240  And,
you know, the only thing that that's
00:01:28.800  challenging about the U.S.
is that a lot of those merits are priced
00:01:32.910  in.
As of what we're saying, though, that
00:01:38.790  that focus on risk and you do talk about
it a lot, and most recently making that
00:01:43.080  analogy to chess, where do you see then
the risk that either real or perhaps
00:01:49.650  more modest, but where are you seeing
those at the moment, those
00:01:52.350  opportunities?
00:01:58.600  Given that the U.S.
has priced highly, a lot of the
00:02:01.480  opportunities for bargains are outside
the U.S.
00:02:06.700  Obviously, China is on a lot of people's
own investible list that tends to
00:02:13.360  depress its value.
And we like to think to look at things
00:02:17.200  that other people aren't interested in.
So China is is one good example.
00:02:22.810  But, you know, we we are not macro
investors.
00:02:27.280  We're not top down.
We don't affect a geographic
00:02:30.970  diversification for its own sake.
We go where the bargains are and we're
00:02:35.920  finding lots of bargains in many places.
Howard is interesting, too.
00:02:41.500  I mean, can you tell us a bit more about
the fund raising environment maybe in
00:02:45.250  Asia here right now?
I mean, you're listening to, you know,
00:02:48.310  asset managers like Apollo that's
pushing into insurance, into wealth here
00:02:51.730  right now.
And at a time when we're seeing rates
00:02:54.010  where you are in Tokyo as well as in
China, are still quite low, you know,
00:02:58.030  how would you describe the fund raising
environment now?
00:03:03.520  A fundraising environment is good.
There's a lot of interested in credit.
00:03:07.690  You know, our sectors were in
hibernation for a long time, just two
00:03:12.700  and a half years ago.
Cash yielded zero and even high yield
00:03:17.050  bonds yielded only four.
Today, the yield close to eight.
00:03:21.640  And from there, it's onward and upward
in terms of yields.
00:03:25.510  So
credit investing can be very rewarding
00:03:29.680  today.
There's a lot of interest in credit
00:03:32.780  investing as a result.
And,
00:03:35.950  you know, we we try to be judicious
about our pace of investing in our pace
00:03:40.270  of fundraising.
But the desire is there on the part of
00:03:45.250  clients, and we continue to make
inroads.
00:03:50.950  And what's been really interesting
because it's been that really explosion
00:03:53.920  in private credit and you've seen a lot
of banks as well getting involved into
00:03:57.460  it.
But what's the role then, that you see
00:04:00.700  private credit playing in the financing
market and also the relationship with
00:04:04.330  traditional lenders as well,
complementary or competitors in this
00:04:08.050  landscape, do you think?
I think mostly complimentary.
00:04:14.970  You know, the the banks in many parts of
the world have pulled back.
00:04:21.120  Well, even as long ago as the global
financial crisis and,
00:04:27.000  you know, higher regulation, higher
capital requirements and so forth.
00:04:30.870  So there has been a place for non-bank
lenders.
00:04:33.960  There continues to be.
So I would say that so far the non-bank
00:04:38.490  lenders have mostly picked up the slack
that the bank lenders
00:04:44.370  created.
Where if the banks come back in full
00:04:48.930  force and the non-bank lenders continue
strongly, we could find competition to
00:04:54.930  lend.
And that's usually not a great thing for
00:04:57.600  lenders.
We don't like to see an oversupply of
00:05:02.010  loan capital.
And do you see any sectors or
00:05:06.780  geographies that are taking more
advantage of private credit growth in
00:05:10.590  particular?
I know you mentioned as well there's
00:05:12.540  opportunities you see in the China
market.
00:05:19.110  The private credit opportunities are
very strong in the US and also strong in
00:05:27.300  in Europe.
Other than that, it's fairly spotty.
00:05:32.310  The the, the onslaught of private credit
has not hit Asia to anything near the
00:05:38.550  same degree.
And how are you mentioned about China
00:05:42.570  giving you good opportunities outside
the US?
00:05:46.110  In particular, I mean, I know you guys
focus more on the loan side of things
00:05:50.610  when it comes to your distressed
strategy in China.
00:05:53.410  I mean, how are you viewing distressed
properties now in the mainline?
00:05:56.940  Is there a sense that you're you're
adding to your exposure in any way or
00:06:00.840  backing away from this sector now?
Well, you know, we've been investors in
00:06:08.410  NPLs for close to ten years.
Non-performing loans, that is every day,
00:06:13.270  every banking system generates some
non-performing loans.
00:06:16.960  China has set up mechanisms to to get
them off the bank's books.
00:06:21.970  And we've been participating for, as I
say, close to ten years.
00:06:26.380  The legal system has operated as it
should.
00:06:29.620  We're happy to continue in that role and
we're not backing away.
00:06:35.350  In terms of I mean, obviously, you were
kind of caught up in what happened with
00:06:38.890  Evergrande as a creditor.
I'm just wondering, you know, were there
00:06:42.160  any lessons that were learned from from
this fallout from Evergrande in this
00:06:46.600  downfall and how much of the assets was
able to salvage?
00:06:56.550  You know, the lesson is
to be careful when a
00:07:05.190  supply is created by a strong
availability of capital.
00:07:12.630  Capital was made available to the
property development sector to so that
00:07:17.400  it could contribute to GDP growth.
It expanded rapidly and made use of that
00:07:21.600  capital, a building that built some
buildings which from time to time turned
00:07:26.520  out to have supply exceeding demand.
You know, we participated.
00:07:32.370  I think another important lesson is, is
it's a good idea to get collateral.
00:07:37.020  We got collateral on our loans to
Evergreen Evergrande when many others
00:07:41.730  didn't.
And we think we're coming out very well.
00:07:46.140  As I mentioned, the legal system is
performing for us.
00:07:50.160  We have got in control of the collateral
and there haven't been any
00:07:54.570  disappointments on that front.
So as I say, we're continuing with our
00:08:00.210  involvement.
Howard, I'm curious because you've made
00:08:05.220  it to Tokyo, of course, and what are the
kinds of conversations you're having
00:08:09.720  with investors there?
What's what sort of investments are you
00:08:13.260  also looking at in the country?
00:08:21.120  Most of our involvement in Japan is
investing outside Japan for Japanese
00:08:26.530  investors.
The yields are fairly low in Japan and
00:08:30.880  generally speaking, not additive to our
global portfolios.
00:08:36.100  But, you know, Oaktree has been
maintaining for over a year and a half a
00:08:41.020  thesis we call SeaChange, which says
that unlike the preceding 13 years,
00:08:48.400  interest rates in the coming 5 to 10
will not be characterized by constantly
00:08:54.580  declining rates or ultra low rates.
That's our thesis.
00:08:59.800  That means that opportunities to make
good money with the risk under control
00:09:05.500  in credit investments is strong and will
persist.
00:09:10.630  That's mostly what we're talking about
here.
00:09:12.640  And
you know, we're conducting a conference
00:09:17.110  this week for our first
regional conference for Asia.
00:09:21.820  And I must say that the reception is
very positive.
00:09:27.600  Yeah.
And certainly there's been so much
00:09:28.980  spotlight on Japan recently.
It's interesting.
00:09:31.890  I was reading your latest memo on Impact
of Debt and you mentioned about a lot of
00:09:36.360  these ultra durable companies in Japan
where there's more than 100 that have
00:09:40.290  been operating for hundreds of years.
And the key thing that you notice is
00:09:43.890  that, you know, they have a lot of cash
and they're not sitting on a whole lot
00:09:46.410  of debt right now.
Do you think this is just a symptom of
00:09:50.010  just once again, overly cautious sort of
corporate management or have we seen a
00:09:55.110  sea change in Japan in some ways given
this wave of corporate governance, or is
00:09:58.650  this just a function of improving
fundamentals that we're seeing among
00:10:02.220  Japan now?
No, I think that the that the Japanese
00:10:08.370  culture is is essentially conservative
in nature and other than a little burst
00:10:14.970  in the eighties really never embraced
aggressive financing and high use of
00:10:21.720  leverage.
And as the memo said, as you say,
00:10:27.030  non-use of leverage is one of the things
that can allow you to survive for very
00:10:31.890  long periods of time.
There's a lesson in that.
00:10:35.310  But I think that
some leverage is good.
00:10:39.720  But each person or each organization has
to identify the level of leverage that's
00:10:45.150  consistent with its with its
circumstances and will lead to a long
00:10:50.220  term survival.
How would you mentioned the need
00:10:54.510  sometimes to having collateralized
loans?
00:10:56.340  And it makes me think about Inter Milan,
of course, and Oaktree took control of
00:11:00.210  that sporting club last month.
What are your plans for it and are you
00:11:04.650  also looking at other sports
investments, given you've got a long
00:11:08.340  link with those as well?
You know,
00:11:16.340  as I say, we're not a strategic top down
investors.
00:11:20.720  We don't say, let's go out and get
involved with a bunch of sports teams.
00:11:24.890  Rather, we make loans when presented
with the opportunity
00:11:30.530  where we think we'll get repaid, where
there's some question about repayment.
00:11:34.520  We like to get collateral.
Of course,
00:11:38.360  the Milan situation Inter was was one of
those.
00:11:42.630  We made a loan to a borrower who
collateralized it with the team didn't
00:11:48.200  pay us.
We ended up as the owners.
00:11:50.540  It was not our intention,
but we're happy with the outcome so far.
00:11:59.180  We're going to pivot once more.
I mean, you talk a little bit more about
00:12:01.430  Howard.
A lot of the good news or maybe in in
00:12:03.890  the US markets are priced in.
A lot of that has to do with what I in
00:12:07.880  general.
I mean,
00:12:09.830  can you tell us more about this?
I aware what this all means.
00:12:13.160  You know, when we are in the US cycle, I
mean, is there is there a bubble still?
00:12:21.040  You know, of all the people you're going
to have on the show today, I probably
00:12:24.130  know the least about A.I..
I'm good at identifying optimism.
00:12:30.190  Obviously, there's optimism surrounding
A.I.
00:12:32.890  today, and there is some, to some modest
degree pervading the market.
00:12:37.840  But I think that
I will not have a profound impact on non
00:12:44.020  AI companies for a good period of time.
And,
00:12:49.510  you know, whenever you have a new, new
thing like A.I., there is usually some
00:12:57.730  aggregation of optimism and and you
certainly have it today.
00:13:03.090  And
but, you know, whether the optimism is
00:13:09.490  appropriate or excessive, you'll have to
find that out from somebody else who who
00:13:14.920  knows about it.
