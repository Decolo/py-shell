[CC may contain inaccuracies] It's interesting, right?
When you talk about I know your favorite
topic is talk about risk and how to look
at risk taking here when you you could
argue that the US cycle is getting, I
guess, towards the late part of things.
Asia.
In some ways it's still in the thick of
it and re-emerging from this pandemic in
some ways as well.
How are you looking at these diverging
cycles around the world here right now?
And is it a time still to be a
contrarian?
You know, the US had a brief period of
difficulty in the second quarter of
2020.
The economy rebounded very nicely in the
third quarter and has been doing very
well since then.
Despite the fact that interest rates
have not been cut.
There are people arguing for stimulus,
but so far they haven't gotten it.
It doesn't seem there's a need to
stimulate it, given how well the economy
is doing and how labor is doing.
But, you know,
obviously, as you say, other countries
are not quite doing quite as well.
There seems to be some asynchronous
elements in the global monetary picture.
But, you know, I think that most things
are going in the right direction.
People are very happy investing in the
in the United States.
They like our the legal system, economic
system, the corporate sector.
And,
you know, the only thing that that's
challenging about the U.S.
is that a lot of those merits are priced
in.
As of what we're saying, though, that
that focus on risk and you do talk about
it a lot, and most recently making that
analogy to chess, where do you see then
the risk that either real or perhaps
more modest, but where are you seeing
those at the moment, those
opportunities?
Given that the U.S.
has priced highly, a lot of the
opportunities for bargains are outside
the U.S.
Obviously, China is on a lot of people's
own investible list that tends to
depress its value.
And we like to think to look at things
that other people aren't interested in.
So China is is one good example.
But, you know, we we are not macro
investors.
We're not top down.
We don't affect a geographic
diversification for its own sake.
We go where the bargains are and we're
finding lots of bargains in many places.
Howard is interesting, too.
I mean, can you tell us a bit more about
the fund raising environment maybe in
Asia here right now?
I mean, you're listening to, you know,
asset managers like Apollo that's
pushing into insurance, into wealth here
right now.
And at a time when we're seeing rates
where you are in Tokyo as well as in
China, are still quite low, you know,
how would you describe the fund raising
environment now?
A fundraising environment is good.
There's a lot of interested in credit.
You know, our sectors were in
hibernation for a long time, just two
and a half years ago.
Cash yielded zero and even high yield
bonds yielded only four.
Today, the yield close to eight.
And from there, it's onward and upward
in terms of yields.
So
credit investing can be very rewarding
today.
There's a lot of interest in credit
investing as a result.
And,
you know, we we try to be judicious
about our pace of investing in our pace
of fundraising.
But the desire is there on the part of
clients, and we continue to make
inroads.
And what's been really interesting
because it's been that really explosion
in private credit and you've seen a lot
of banks as well getting involved into
it.
But what's the role then, that you see
private credit playing in the financing
market and also the relationship with
traditional lenders as well,
complementary or competitors in this
landscape, do you think?
I think mostly complimentary.
You know, the the banks in many parts of
the world have pulled back.
Well, even as long ago as the global
financial crisis and,
you know, higher regulation, higher
capital requirements and so forth.
So there has been a place for non-bank
lenders.
There continues to be.
So I would say that so far the non-bank
lenders have mostly picked up the slack
that the bank lenders
created.
Where if the banks come back in full
force and the non-bank lenders continue
strongly, we could find competition to
lend.
And that's usually not a great thing for
lenders.
We don't like to see an oversupply of
loan capital.
And do you see any sectors or
geographies that are taking more
advantage of private credit growth in
particular?
I know you mentioned as well there's
opportunities you see in the China
market.
The private credit opportunities are
very strong in the US and also strong in
in Europe.
Other than that, it's fairly spotty.
The the, the onslaught of private credit
has not hit Asia to anything near the
same degree.
And how are you mentioned about China
giving you good opportunities outside
the US?
In particular, I mean, I know you guys
focus more on the loan side of things
when it comes to your distressed
strategy in China.
I mean, how are you viewing distressed
properties now in the mainline?
Is there a sense that you're you're
adding to your exposure in any way or
backing away from this sector now?
Well, you know, we've been investors in
NPLs for close to ten years.
Non-performing loans, that is every day,
every banking system generates some
non-performing loans.
China has set up mechanisms to to get
them off the bank's books.
And we've been participating for, as I
say, close to ten years.
The legal system has operated as it
should.
We're happy to continue in that role and
we're not backing away.
In terms of I mean, obviously, you were
kind of caught up in what happened with
Evergrande as a creditor.
I'm just wondering, you know, were there
any lessons that were learned from from
this fallout from Evergrande in this
downfall and how much of the assets was
able to salvage?
You know, the lesson is
to be careful when a
supply is created by a strong
availability of capital.
Capital was made available to the
property development sector to so that
it could contribute to GDP growth.
It expanded rapidly and made use of that
capital, a building that built some
buildings which from time to time turned
out to have supply exceeding demand.
You know, we participated.
I think another important lesson is, is
it's a good idea to get collateral.
We got collateral on our loans to
Evergreen Evergrande when many others
didn't.
And we think we're coming out very well.
As I mentioned, the legal system is
performing for us.
We have got in control of the collateral
and there haven't been any
disappointments on that front.
So as I say, we're continuing with our
involvement.
Howard, I'm curious because you've made
it to Tokyo, of course, and what are the
kinds of conversations you're having
with investors there?
What's what sort of investments are you
also looking at in the country?
Most of our involvement in Japan is
investing outside Japan for Japanese
investors.
The yields are fairly low in Japan and
generally speaking, not additive to our
global portfolios.
But, you know, Oaktree has been
maintaining for over a year and a half a
thesis we call SeaChange, which says
that unlike the preceding 13 years,
interest rates in the coming 5 to 10
will not be characterized by constantly
declining rates or ultra low rates.
That's our thesis.
That means that opportunities to make
good money with the risk under control
in credit investments is strong and will
persist.
That's mostly what we're talking about
here.
And
you know, we're conducting a conference
this week for our first
regional conference for Asia.
And I must say that the reception is
very positive.
Yeah.
And certainly there's been so much
spotlight on Japan recently.
It's interesting.
I was reading your latest memo on Impact
of Debt and you mentioned about a lot of
these ultra durable companies in Japan
where there's more than 100 that have
been operating for hundreds of years.
And the key thing that you notice is
that, you know, they have a lot of cash
and they're not sitting on a whole lot
of debt right now.
Do you think this is just a symptom of
just once again, overly cautious sort of
corporate management or have we seen a
sea change in Japan in some ways given
this wave of corporate governance, or is
this just a function of improving
fundamentals that we're seeing among
Japan now?
No, I think that the that the Japanese
culture is is essentially conservative
in nature and other than a little burst
in the eighties really never embraced
aggressive financing and high use of
leverage.
And as the memo said, as you say,
non-use of leverage is one of the things
that can allow you to survive for very
long periods of time.
There's a lesson in that.
But I think that
some leverage is good.
But each person or each organization has
to identify the level of leverage that's
consistent with its with its
circumstances and will lead to a long
term survival.
How would you mentioned the need
sometimes to having collateralized
loans?
And it makes me think about Inter Milan,
of course, and Oaktree took control of
that sporting club last month.
What are your plans for it and are you
also looking at other sports
investments, given you've got a long
link with those as well?
You know,
as I say, we're not a strategic top down
investors.
We don't say, let's go out and get
involved with a bunch of sports teams.
Rather, we make loans when presented
with the opportunity
where we think we'll get repaid, where
there's some question about repayment.
We like to get collateral.
Of course,
the Milan situation Inter was was one of
those.
We made a loan to a borrower who
collateralized it with the team didn't
pay us.
We ended up as the owners.
It was not our intention,
but we're happy with the outcome so far.
We're going to pivot once more.
I mean, you talk a little bit more about
Howard.
A lot of the good news or maybe in in
the US markets are priced in.
A lot of that has to do with what I in
general.
I mean,
can you tell us more about this?
I aware what this all means.
You know, when we are in the US cycle, I
mean, is there is there a bubble still?
You know, of all the people you're going
to have on the show today, I probably
know the least about A.I..
I'm good at identifying optimism.
Obviously, there's optimism surrounding
A.I.
today, and there is some, to some modest
degree pervading the market.
But I think that
I will not have a profound impact on non
AI companies for a good period of time.
And,
you know, whenever you have a new, new
thing like A.I., there is usually some
aggregation of optimism and and you
certainly have it today.
And
but, you know, whether the optimism is
appropriate or excessive, you'll have to
find that out from somebody else who who
knows about it.
